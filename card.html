			<p><i>Axolotls were named after Xolotl, the Aztec god of fire and
					lightning, who could take on the form of a salamander.</i></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Scientific Name</span>: Ambystoma Mexicanum</li>
				<li><span>Average Length</span>: 9 inches</li>
				<li><span>Average Lifespan</span>: 5-6 years in the wild, 10-15 years in
					captivity</li>
				<li><span>Habitat</span>: Freshwater</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Axolotl is unusual among amphibians because it reaches adulthood
				without undergoing metamorphosis. They do not heal by scarring, instead
				they are able to regenerate their limbs, gills and parts of their eyes
				and brains in a period of months.</p>
